## ‚úÖ Additional Notes:

### üí° Visualization Tools Suggestions:

* Use **Chart.js**, **D3.js**, or **ECharts** for rendering charts in web dashboard.
* For heatmaps or calendars, **FullCalendar** or **GitHub-style heatmaps** are great.
* Paginate long tables and make stats exportable (CSV, PDF).

Would you like **mockup wireframes or UI layout suggestions** for these dashboards as well?
